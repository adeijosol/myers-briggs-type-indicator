notes for the test module (notes.txt):

* consider making trials in 1000

two outer dictionaries to hold values for comparison

declare local dictionary
repeat 100 times
	create sample of 100 objects
		calculate percentages for each personality type
	add to local dictionary
calculate average results
store values in one of the outer dictionaries

repeat above for second algorithm...

compare first and second results to expected values
	create table (for manual and visual comparison)
	compute which results have the _smaller_ percentage difference
