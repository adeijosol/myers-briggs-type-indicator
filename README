MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Inventory)

About
-----

A program that generates a number of MBTI personality type objects in the correct percentage given the sample space based on the probabilities given in http://www.mypersonality.info/

Background and History
----------------------

This project started out as a way to practice programming using concepts in Statstics. I decided to use 'data' for the MBTI to make it more interesting. I might use this in possible future projects (e.g. games, simulations, etc.).
